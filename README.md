A Python package for detecting equilibration in time series where an initial transient is followed by a stationary distribution. Two main approaches are implemented, which differ in the way they account for autocorrelation:

  - `detect_equilibration_init_seq`: This uses the initial sequence methods of Geyer ([Geyer, 1992](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2246094)) to determine the truncation point of the sum of autocovariances. Chodera's method ([Chodera, 2016](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00784)) of simply truncating the autocovariance series at the first negative value is also implemented.
  - `detect_equilibration_window`: This uses window methods (see [Geyer](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2246094) again) when calculating the
autocorrelation. Setting the window size to 1 will give you White's original Marginal Standard Error Rule ([White, 1997](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/003754979706900601)).

For both, the equilibration point can be determined either according to the minimum of the squared standard error (the default), or the maximum effective sample size, by specifying `method="min_sse"` or `method="max_ess"`.

### Installation

The easiest way to install `red` is using `conda` (or `mamba`) (note that the conda-forge/ PyPI name is `red-molsim` to avoid conflicts):

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge red-molsim
```

Alternatively, you can install `red` from the Python Package Index (PyPI) using `pip`:

```bash
pip install red-molsim
```

### Usage

**Warning**: `red` will work with multi-run data, but has only been thoroughly tested with single-run data. Using multi-run data is likely to be more robust, but we have not verified this.

#### Equilibration Detection

```python
import red

# Load your timeseries of interest.
# This should be a 2D numpy array with shape (n_runs, n_samples),
# or a 1D numpy array with shape (n_samples).
my_timeseries = ...

# Detect equilibration based on the minimum squared standard error using
# using the window method with a Bartlett kernel with a window size of
# round(n_samples**0.5) to account for autocorrelation. idx is the index
# of the first sample after equilibration, g is the statistical
# inefficiency of the equilibrated sample, and ess is the effective sample
# size of the equilibrated sample.
idx, g, ess = red.detect_equilibration_window(my_timeseries,
                                              method="min_sse",
                                              plot=True)

# Alternatively, use Geyer's initial convex sequence method to account
# for autocorrelation.
idx, g, ess = red.detect_equilibration_init_seq(my_timeseries,
                                                method="min_sse",
                                                plot=True)

# We can also determine equilibration in the same way as in
# pymbar.timeseries.detect_equilibration(my_timeseries, fast=False)
idx, g, ess = red.detect_equilibration_init_seq(my_timeseries,
                                                method="max_ess",
                                                sequence_estimator="positive")
```

#### Uncertainty Quantification

```python
# Estimate the 95 % confidence interval, accounting for autocorrelation using Geyer's initial
# convex sequence method.
ci_95 = red.get_conf_int_init_seq(my_timeseries, alpha_two_tailed=0.05)

```
